# Session 0 - GA Capstone
## Description

**Session 0** is a social groups app designed to help tabletop roleplayers find groups to join! There are many features in the pipeline for further functionality, but this initial prototype is an example of how the app would function at a small scale.

The new tech I'll be learning for this project is FaunaDB and FQL. This will be used to manage the social connections at the center of the app.

### Routes Table
- Due to the way Fauna handles authentication, all requests from logged in users are POST requests.

| --- | ------ | ---------- | ----- | --------- |
| `/` | GET | none | - | Test route to show DB is online |
| `/login` | POST | Users | users_by_email | login a user has already created an account, returns a token and userRef |
| `/signup` | POST | Users | users_by_email | creates a new user and then immediately logs them in. also fills in boilerplate profile information |

| `/user/:id` | POST | Users | - | get a users profile by their userRef |
| `/user` | PUT | Users | - | allows the logged in user to update their profile |
| `/group` | POST | Groups | - | create a new group (doesn't assign user relationships to group)|
| `/group/:id` | POST | Groups | member_by_group, member+role_by_group | Returns all info needed to render a group's page, including user roles and relationships to the group |
| `/allgroups` | POST | Groups | all_groups_paginate | returns a list of all groups and their information |
| `/group/:id` | PUT | Groups | update a group's information |
